# Node-Based Power System

## Core Premise
In this world, power is not measured by levels or accumulated experience points. Instead, an individual's strength, skills, and very essence are defined by a dynamic and intricate **Node Graph**. This system represents the sum of their knowledge, abilities, and destiny, woven together through connections called **Links**. A character's overall standing in the world is determined by their **Tier**, which is a direct reflection of the most powerful **Node** they have managed to acquire.

## Character Tier
A character does not have a level. Their power and influence are classified by their **Tier**.

*   **Definition**: A character's Tier is equal to the Tier of the highest-rated Node they possess.
*   **Significance**: Achieving a new Tier is a momentous occasion, signifying a breakthrough in a specific and potent area of power. A Tier 5 character is not just "Level 5"; they are a "Heroic Tier" individual because they have accomplished a Heroic-level feat to unlock a corresponding Node.

## Nodes
Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of power and identity. Each Node represents a single, discrete concept, such as:

*   **Active Skills**: A new spell or combat maneuver.
*   **Passive Abilities**: A persistent bonus, like increased strength or faster mana regeneration.
*   **Knowledge**: A crafting recipe, a piece of lore, a new language, or the key to a diplomatic option.
*   **Titles & Reputations**: A title that changes how NPCs react to you.
*   **Mutations**: A permanent change to the character's body or mind.

### Node Tiers
Each Node has a Tier, indicating its rarity, power, and the difficulty of its acquisition.

| Tier          | Number        | Description                                                                                             |
|---------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Common**    | 1             | Basic abilities and knowledge. The foundation of any path.                                              |
| **Uncommon**  | 2             | Specialized but accessible skills.                                                                      |
| **Rare**      | 3             | Powerful and defining abilities that require significant effort or discovery.                           |
| **Renowned**  | 4             | Feats of power that bring local fame and recognition.                                                   |
| **Heroic**    | 5             | Abilities that mark one as a true hero, capable of changing the fate of a region.                       |
| **Epic**      | 6             | Kingdom-shaking power that becomes the subject of songs and legends.                                    |
| **Legendary** | 7             | Powers that rival the great heroes of history. The character becomes a living legend.                   |
| **Immortal**  | 8             | Abilities that touch upon the fundamental forces of the world, granting a form of immortality or godlike power. |
| **Ascendance**| 9             | The pinnacle of mortal achievement, blurring the line between person and concept.                       |

#### Special Tiers
These exist outside the standard path of progression and represent transcendent or alien forms of power.

*   **Mythical/Godly (Negative Numbers, e.g., -1, -5)**: These Nodes represent direct power from or over the divine and primordial forces of the world (e.g., `[Node: Heart of the Fire God, Tier: -7]`). They are not inherently "better" than Ascendance Nodes but operate on entirely different principles. Acquisition might involve defeating a divine being, receiving a direct blessing, or merging with a fundamental concept.
*   **Outer/Complex (Complex Numbers, e.g., 1+2i, 3-i)**: This tier represents incomprehensible, reality-warping power from beyond the known universe. These Nodes often come with significant, unpredictable drawbacks. They might introduce paradoxical effects or abilities that defy conventional logic (e.g., `[Node: Gaze into the Fractal Eye, Tier: 2+3i]`).

## Links and Linking

### Linking
**Linking** is the process of acquiring a new Node. To obtain a new Node, a character must already possess a thematically or logically related Node that can form a **Link** to it. You cannot learn `[Advanced Swordsmanship]` if you do not have a Link from `[Basic Swordsmanship]`.

### Links
A **Link** is the connection between two Nodes. By default, a Link is a simple prerequisite. However, Links themselves can be a source of power.

*   **Standard Link**: A simple connection. `[Node A] -> [Node B]`.
*   **Enhanced Link**: A Link that has been improved, granting a bonus when both connected Nodes are active or influencing the skill order.
*   **Tether Link**: A special, long-range Link that allows a connection between two Nodes that are not adjacent in the graph, often requiring a rare component or a specific story beat to create.

### Node Acquisition
The method of unlocking a new, potential Node (making it available for Linking) is varied and core to the game's exploration and interaction.

*   **Combat**: Defeating a powerful foe may unlock a Node related to their abilities.
*   **Research**: Studying a tome in a library or reverse-engineering a magical item.
*   **Activities**: Mastering a craft, winning a tournament, or exploring a hidden location.
*   **Dialogue & Exchange**: A master may teach you a new skill, or you could trade a rare item for a Knowledge Node.
*   **Discovery**: Finding a hidden altar or witnessing a celestial event.

## Enhancement
Both Nodes and Links can be enhanced through specific actions, resources, or story achievements.

*   **Node Enhancement**:
    *   **Effect Modification**: Change a `[Fireball]` Node to deal frost damage or become an area-of-effect spell.
    *   **Attribute Tuning**: Increase the damage, reduce the cost, or add a secondary effect to the Node's ability.
*   **Link Enhancement**:
    *   **Synergy Bonus**: Enhancing the Link between `[Fireball]` and `[Increased Area of Effect]` could grant a bonus "Conflagration" effect that leaves burning ground.
    *   **Trigger Order**: Modify a Link to change the activation order of skills in a chain.
    *   **Creating Tether Links**: A major enhancement could be converting a standard Link into a Tether, allowing you to connect it to a distant, unrelated Node to create a unique hybrid ability.

## Unique Nodes and Links
The ultimate form of power and individuality comes from **Unique** Nodes and Links.

*   **Definition**: A Unique Node or Link can only be possessed by a single character in the entire world at any given time.
*   **Acquisition**: These are tied to once-in-a-lifetime events: defeating a world-ending boss for the first time, being the first to craft a legendary item, or making a pivotal, world-altering story choice.
*   **Transfer**: If the character who possesses a Unique Node dies, that Node may become available again in the world, waiting for a new individual to prove themselves worthy of claiming it. For example, the `[Unique Node: Slayer of the Dragon King]` becomes available to the next person who performs a comparable feat.

This system encourages players to seek out diverse experiences, forge their own path, and create a character that is truly their own, defined not by a number, but by a web of choices, achievements, and power.
