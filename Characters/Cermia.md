## Background & Notes
**Tag**: #Knight #Gambler #Human #Tier2Enemy #Tier2Ally

**Story Presence**: A fiercely competitive but horribly unlucky knight who struggles with gambling addiction and impulsive behavior. Despite her flaws, she's a skilled swordwoman and talented fire magician.

**Personality**: Hot-headed and impulsive, prone to taking dangerous risks both in combat and at the gambling table. Her competitive nature drives her to prove herself, but her terrible luck often undermines her efforts. Lives off an allowance from her more responsible sister Carrot, who inherited the family fortune due to Cermia's reckless spending.

**Combat Style**: Unpredictable and aggressive, favoring fire-enhanced sword techniques. Her gambling nature makes her willing to take risky maneuvers for potentially devastating attacks, but this can backfire spectacularly.

**Plot Hooks**:
- Can be encountered at gambling dens across various towns
- Might challenge the party to gambling games or duels
- Could be hired as a mercenary if the price is right
- Her sister Carrot might seek the party's help in dealing with Cermia's debts
- Knows information about noble circles and underground gambling networks
