## Background & Notes
**Tag**: #Bandit #FailedKnight #WolfBeastman #Tier2Enemy

**Story Presence**: A notorious bandit leader that terrorizes the surroundings of Harken Town. Once a promising knight candidate, Jeno was expelled from his order for acts of brutality and corruption. His fall from grace turned him bitter and ruthless, leading him to embrace a life of crime. His wolf heritage gives him enhanced senses and predatory instincts, making him a formidable opponent both in direct combat and as a tactical leader.

**Combat Tactics**: Jeno prefers to fight alongside his bandit underlings, using his Coordinated Assault to orchestrate devastating group attacks. He opens combat with intimidating howls and commands before closing in with his war axe. His Predator's Instinct makes him increasingly dangerous as enemies begin to bleed, growing stronger with each wounded foe. If outnumbered or outmatched, he relies on his pack coordination and tactical leadership to create escape opportunities.

**Personality**: Bitter about his past failures, vindictive toward authority figures, but fiercely loyal to those who follow him. He sees his banditry as justified revenge against a society that rejected him.
