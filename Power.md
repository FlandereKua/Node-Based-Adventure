# Power System
The Power System of Eonia is built around supernatural abilities that manifest through interconnected Nodes, representing the evolution of mortals into beings capable of wielding forces beyond natural law. This system governs not only individual strength but also shapes the very fabric of society, creating hierarchies, conflicts, and opportunities that define civilization itself.
## Node 
Node are the backbone of the Supernatural in this world. It could represent a mastery in skills, a special physical physique, an affinity.
Normally, Node are connected with each other by **Link**

Node could be benefictial or demetrial 
**Example**: 
*Sword Mastery I*: Grant bonus DMG when using a sword.
or
*Heavenly Restriction (Unique)*: Grant Extreme Boost to physical capabilities but render the user unable to use magic.
Node are separated into Tier and Quality

There are  Tiers:
Common: 1
Uncommon: 2
Rare: 3
Heroic: 4
Epic: 5
Legendary: 6
Mythical: 7
Transcendence: 8

Quality:
Basic
Perfect
Unique

A supernatural being power rank is determined by their highest note level. 
Example: So a person with the highest ranked node being Heroic is considered Heroic-rank.
There are **multiple ways** to acquire nodes:
Including but not limited to:
- Slaying Supernatural being
- Training
- Research
- Potions
- etc....
However to acquire any node, a person must have at least one of the adjacent node to it.
