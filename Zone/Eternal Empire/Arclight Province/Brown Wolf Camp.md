# Brown Wolf Camp (Tier 1-2 Hostile Zone)

## Overview
Hidden deep within a secluded valley of Harken Forest, the Brown Wolf Camp is a fortified bandit stronghold built around a natural clearing. Crude wooden palisades surround ramshackle structures constructed from stolen lumber and salvaged materials. The camp reeks of unwashed bodies, stale ale, and woodsmoke from poorly maintained fires. This lawless settlement serves as a base for raiders who prey on trade routes and isolated travelers, led by the ruthless mercenary captain known as "Iron-Scar Gareth."

The camp is always on alert, with sentries posted at key positions and guard rotations that make stealth approaches challenging but not impossible.
