# Brown Wolf Camp (Tier 2) (Enemy Zone)

## Overview
A fortified bandit stronghold hidden in a forest clearing, the camp bristles with watch posts, palisades, and trapped approaches. Sentries rotate often, dogs prowl, and loot flows through a locked counting house. Travelers come here to end raids, reclaim stolen goods, or turn the bandits against greater threats.
