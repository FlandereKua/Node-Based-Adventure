# Spiregate Market (Tier 2 Town)

## Overview
Directly adjoining Arken Town at its eastern crossroads—where the Arken Road meets the haulway toward the river landings and the Harken Forest trail—Spiregate is the principal market hub for the Arclight Province’s western reaches. Stone-paved arteries feed a constant flow of merchant wagons, pack trains, and hand-carts into terraced squares ringed with counting houses and guild banners. Bells mark auction hours; criers shout prices; porters weave through the crush with practiced ease. If it can be bought near Arken, it passes through Spiregate.
