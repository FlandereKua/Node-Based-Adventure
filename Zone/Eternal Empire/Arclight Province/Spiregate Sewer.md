# Spiregate Sewer (Tier 2) (Enemy Zone)

## Overview
Beneath Spiregate’s terraces runs a lattice of storm drains, culverts, and brickwork galleries channeling runoff toward the river. Echoing tunnels, ankle-to-knee deep flows, and maintenance catwalks create a maze of tight lanes and sudden chambers. Patrols avoid the worst stretches—where goblins skulk, rat swarms churn, and phosphorescent growth paints the walls. Players come for stealth and ambush practice, lightcrafting reagents, and disease-prep nodes ahead of deeper ruins.
