# Harken Forest (Tier 1) (Enemy Zone)

## Overview
An ancient woodland of towering ironwoods, mossy understory, and constant birdsong. Safe enough for first ventures yet full of lessons: pack predators, stinging swarms, and patient plants that reward timing. Travelers come for starter combat nodes, basic recipes, and gentle stealth practice along shaded trails and creek crossings.
