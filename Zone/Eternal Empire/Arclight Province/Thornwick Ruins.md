# Thornwick Ruins (Tier 2-3 Haunted Zone)

## Overview
Once the prosperous village of Thornwick, this area was abandoned decades ago after a mysterious plague swept through the population. Now overgrown with twisted thorns and unnatural vegetation, the ruins are haunted by restless spirits and corrupted wildlife. The very ground seems tainted, with patches of blackened soil that nothing healthy will grow upon.

Ancient stone foundations peek through masses of thorny vines, while collapsed roofs and shattered walls create a maze of dangerous passages. An unnatural mist clings to the ruins during certain hours, and travelers report hearing voices calling from empty doorways. The area pulses with malevolent spiritual energy that affects both the living and the dead.

## Connection to Node-Based System

Thornwick Ruins serves as an excellent source of high-tier spiritual and medical nodes, contrasting with the more mundane combat and social nodes available from Brown Wolf Camp. The zone's emphasis on supernatural threats and curse mechanics integrates well with the game's node system by:

1. **Offering Specialized Nodes**: Many nodes here are unique to spiritual/undead encounters
2. **Teaching Advanced Concepts**: Players learn about curse mechanics, spirit communication, and the intersection of nature/holy magic
3. **Providing Moral Choices**: The redemption path offers alternative solutions that require different node combinations
4. **Environmental Integration**: Hazards and exploration rewards encourage diverse node builds beyond pure combat

The zone works best for parties that have already mastered basic combat and are ready to tackle more complex, puzzle-like encounters that require specific node combinations to solve effectively.
