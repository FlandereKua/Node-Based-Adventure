# Thornwick Ruins (Tier 3) (Enemy Zone)

## Overview
Once the prosperous village of Thornwick, these ivy-choked ruins now pulse with malevolent spiritual energy. Thorn mazes shift when unwatched, graves heave, and a cold, whispering hush hangs over the chapel and well. Travelers come seeking rare spirit knowledge, powerful corruption cures, and hard-won lessons from the dead—and many do not return.
