# Alicia - Moonlit Sword (Secret Recruitable Character)

## Overview
Alicia is a rare, secret recruitable character with extraordinary potential hidden beneath a broken exterior. She represents one of the most challenging recruitment opportunities in the Arclight Province, requiring careful attention to timing, specific conditions, and a delicate approach to her fragile emotional state.

---

## Background
An orphaned girl whose parents were brutally murdered by bandits three years ago. Since then, Alicia has lived as a scavenger on the outskirts of Arken Town, surviving day by day through small acts of charity and foraging. The trauma has left her seemingly hollow, moving through life without purpose or hope. Unknown to all, including herself, she possesses a dormant connection to lunar magic that could awaken under the right circumstances.

## Character Profile
*   **Age**: 16
*   **Appearance**: A thin, pale girl with long silver hair often covering her face. Wears tattered, oversized clothes that were once fine quality. Her eyes, when visible, are a striking pale blue that seem to reflect moonlight even in daylight.
*   **Personality**: Appears demure, lifeless, and without motivation. Speaks in whispers when she speaks at all. Shows signs of severe depression and trauma, but beneath the surface lies a fierce protective instinct and untapped magical potential.
*   **Tier**: 1 (Common) - *but with Tier 3+ potential*
*   **Unique Node**: `[Moonlit Divinity - Tier 3]` - Grants significant magic damage amplification, increased mana pool, magic penetration, and converts all physical damage to magical damage.

## Recruitment Window
**Time Limit**: 30 in-game days from first arriving in Arken Town
**Critical Event**: Father Matthias, a traveling priest, will arrive after 30 days to recruit promising young people for the Church. If Alicia has not been recruited by then, she will join him and become unavailable unless the player join the Church Faction.

## Chain Quest: "Light in the Darkness"

### Quest 1: "The Silent Observer"
*   **Trigger**: First visit to Arken Town
*   **Objective**: Notice Alicia
*   **Description**: While exploring Arken Town, players can spot a figure sitting alone behind the Herbalist's Hut during certain times of day (dawn and dusk only). She flees if approached directly.
*   **Hints**: 
    *   Gunnar at the tavern: "That girl? Been around for years. Quiet as a mouse. Some say she's cursed."
    *   Master Faelan: "Poor child. I leave food scraps for her sometimes. She won't take charity directly."
*   **Completion**: Simply observe Alicia without frightening her away (requires `[Stealth]` or `[Silent Step]` node, or approaching very slowly)

### Quest 2: "Small Kindnesses"
*   **Trigger**: Complete "The Silent Observer"
*   **Objective**: Help Alicia indirectly three times
*   **Requirements**: Must be done without direct interaction
*   **Possible Actions**:
    *   Leave food near her usual resting spots (behind Herbalist's Hut or near the old well)
    *   Pay for her meal anonymously through Gunnar when she occasionally visits the tavern
    *   Repair the broken fence she uses as shelter during rain
    *   Drive away the local bullies who sometimes harass her (without her knowledge)
*   **Note**: Direct charity will cause her to flee and reset progress
*   **Completion**: Successfully complete three indirect helpful acts over the course of at least 7 days

### Quest 3: "Echoes of the Past"
*   **Trigger**: Complete "Small Kindnesses" and possess `[Herbalism]` or `[Basic Healing Arts]` node
*   **Objective**: Treat Alicia's infected wound
*   **Description**: Alicia has cut her hand on some broken glass and the wound is becoming infected. She's too withdrawn to seek help.
*   **Approach**: Can only be initiated during a full moon night. Approach slowly with healing supplies visible. She will initially recoil but desperation will make her accept help.
*   **Dialogue Options**:
    *   **Correct**: "I won't hurt you. Let me help with that wound." (gentle, calm tone)
    *   **Wrong**: "Come here, I need to fix that." (causes her to flee)
    *   **Wrong**: "You can't take care of yourself properly." (causes her to flee)
*   **Completion**: Successfully treat her wound and have the first real conversation

### Quest 4: "Shared Sorrow"
*   **Trigger**: Complete "Echoes of the Past"
*   **Objective**: Learn about Alicia's past and share it
*   **Requirements**: Must have completed at least one quest involving combat against bandits or helping other townspeople
*   **Description**: Through careful, patient conversation, learn about the bandit attack that killed her parents. This requires multiple visits over several days.
*   **Key Revelation**: Her parents were traveling merchants who were killed defending a caravan. Alicia survived by hiding in their wagon, but has blamed herself ever since.
*   **Critical Choice**: When she reveals her guilt, the player must respond appropriately:
    *   **Correct**: "Your parents would be proud you survived. Their sacrifice wasn't in vain."
    *   **Correct**: "You were just a child. The fault lies with the bandits, not you."
    *   **Wrong**: "You should move on from the past." (reduces relationship)
    *   **Wrong**: "At least you're alive." (major relationship damage)
*   **Completion**: Successfully navigate the conversation and gain her tentative trust

### Quest 5: "The Awakening Moon"
*   **Trigger**: Complete "Shared Sorrow" and wait for the next full moon (must be within 25 days of first arrival)
*   **Objective**: Witness and guide Alicia's magical awakening
*   **Description**: During the full moon, Alicia experiences her first magical manifestation. Silver light emanates from her hands, but she's terrified and doesn't understand what's happening.
*   **Location**: The old shrine outside town where her parents are buried
*   **Challenge**: Calm her fears and help her understand her power
*   **Required**: Must have `[Mana Sensitivity]` or `[Basic Ritual Knowledge]` node to properly guide her
*   **Critical Moment**: Alicia will panic and the magical energy will become unstable. Player must:
    *   Use magical knowledge to help her focus the energy safely
    *   Speak calmly to prevent her from rejecting her power entirely
    *   Physical comfort (if relationship is high enough) to ground her emotionally
*   **Completion**: Successfully help her control the initial manifestation

### Final Quest: "Choice of Destiny"
*   **Trigger**: Complete "The Awakening Moon"
*   **Objective**: Convince Alicia to join your party before Father Matthias arrives
*   **Time Pressure**: Must be completed within 3 days of quest activation
*   **Description**: Alicia now understands she has power but is afraid of it and what it might mean. She's torn between hiding from her abilities and embracing them.
*   **Recruitment Dialogue**:
    *   "I've never had anyone who understood before. Maybe... maybe I don't have to be alone."
    *   "My parents died protecting others. Perhaps I can honor them by doing the same."
    *   "This power frightens me, but with you, I think I could learn to use it for good."
*   **Final Choice**: Alicia will only agree if:
    *   All previous quests were completed successfully
    *   Player has demonstrated combat ability (defeated at least 5 Gloomfang Wolves)
    *   Player has shown consistent kindness and patience
    *   Player promises to help her learn to control her abilities

## Failure Outcomes

### Early Failure (Quests 1-3)
*   **Cause**: Approaching too aggressively, offering direct charity, or failing to help consistently
*   **Result**: Alicia becomes too frightened and flees Arken Town entirely. She returns as Father Matthias's ward after 30 days.

### Late Failure (Quests 4-5)
*   **Cause**: Poor dialogue choices, missing the time window, or lacking required nodes
*   **Result**: Alicia's magical awakening goes wrong, causing a small magical explosion. Father Matthias arrives early to investigate and takes her to the Church for "protection" and training.

### Time Failure
*   **Cause**: Not completing the chain within 30 days
*   **Result**: Father Matthias arrives and successfully recruits Alicia through conventional religious comfort. She leaves willingly but with suppressed magical abilities.
