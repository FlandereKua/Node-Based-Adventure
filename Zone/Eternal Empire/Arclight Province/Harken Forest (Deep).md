# Harken Forest (Deep) (Tier 2 Zone)

## Overview
The deeper reaches of Harken Forest follow the winding Serpentwater River, where the thick canopy parts to reveal glistening currents and moss-covered banks. The air here is thick with humidity, and the ground squelches underfoot with rich, dark soil. The haunting songs of frogs and the distant splash of unseen creatures punctuate the forest's natural symphony. This aquatic realm presents greater challenges than the outer forest, but also offers unique rewards for those brave enough to venture into its watery depths.
