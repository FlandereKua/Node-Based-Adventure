# Arken Town (Tier 1-2 Zone)

## Overview
Nestled on the edge of the vast Harken Forest, Arken Town is a small, resilient settlement built on the lumber and resources extracted from the woods. The architecture is rustic and functional, dominated by sturdy Ironwood logs and rough-hewn stone. A constant, gentle aroma of sawdust and woodsmoke hangs in the air. Arken serves as a vital first stop for adventurers, offering basic services, training, and a safe haven from the forest's dangers.
