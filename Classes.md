## Advanced & Esoteric Classes

This section details classes that are rarer and often require specific world events, research, or the discovery of unique Nodes to unlock.

### Chronomancer Class
Masters of time, Chronomancers manipulate the flow of battle by speeding up allies, slowing foes, and even reversing moments of damage. Unlocking this class might require interacting with a Temporal Rift or finding an ancient time-keeping artifact.

**Mastery Paths:**
*   **Timeweaver**: Focuses on buffs and debuffs.
    *   **Core Abilities**: `Haste`, `Slow`, `Temporal Shield` (absorbs damage and releases it later).
    *   **Ultimate**: `Chrono-Stasis` - Freezes a large area in time, making enemies helpless while allies can act freely within the bubble.

    *   **Core Abilities**: `Rewind` (reverts an ally's health and position to what it was a few seconds ago), `Temporal Anchor` (prevents allies in an area from being moved or displaced), `Precognition` (grants allies a high chance to dodge incoming attacks).
    *   **Ultimate**: `Déjà Vu` - Marks a location. If a hero dies, they are instead returned to the marked location with 50% health.

    *   **Core Abilities**: `Paradox Blast` (deals damage that increases based on how much the target has recently acted), `Time Loop` (traps an enemy in a short loop, forcing them to repeat their last action while taking damage), `Unravel` (removes enemy buffs and deals damage for each one removed).
    *   **Ultimate**: `Cascade Failure` - Curses a target. Any action the target takes has a chance to create a damaging temporal echo on a nearby enemy.

### Psion Class
Wielding the power of the mind, Psions bypass physical limitations to assault enemies directly, control the battlefield with telekinesis, or bolster allies with psychic fortitude. This class may be unlocked by encountering an otherworldly entity or surviving a psychic anomaly in the Mist.

**Mastery Paths:**

    *   **Core Abilities**: `Psychic Domination` (temporarily converts an enemy to fight for you), `Hallucination` (creates a phantom copy of a powerful ally that enemies will target), `Mind Sear` (deals damage over time and prevents ability usage).
    *   **Ultimate**: `Mass Hysteria` - Causes all enemies in a large area to become confused, attacking the nearest unit, friend or foe.

    *   **Core Abilities**: `Psi-Lance` (a fast, armor-piercing ranged attack), `Aegis of Thought` (creates a shield that absorbs damage and converts it into energy for the Psion), `Blade Dance` (unleashes a flurry of psychic blades in an area around the hero).
    *   **Ultimate**: `Mind's Edge` - For a short duration, all of the hero's attacks deal pure damage that ignores all defenses and shields.

### Druid (Shapeshifter) Class
Druids are deeply connected to the primal forces of nature, able to command wildlife, call upon nature's fury, and even take the form of powerful beasts. Unlocking the Druid requires earning the trust of a powerful nature spirit or purifying a heavily corrupted biome.

**Mastery Paths:**
*   **Warden of the Wild**: Transforms into durable beasts to lead the charge.
    *   **Core Forms**: `Bear Form` (high health, taunts, and area damage), `Wolf Form` (high speed, single-target damage, and pack buffs).

    *   **Ultimate**: `Earthquake` - Drastically slows all enemies on the map and deals periodic physical damage to them and their structures.

### Artificer Class
The Artificer is a master of invention and engineering, creating complex gadgets, automated turrets, and powerful golems to control the battlefield through technology.

    *   **Core Abilities**: `Stun Grenade`, `Repair Drone` (heals mechanical units and structures), `Tesla Coil` (zaps nearby enemies with chain lightning).
    *   **Ultimate**: `Supply Drop` - Calls in a crate that contains several random, powerful gadgets for immediate use.

    *   **Core Abilities**: `Gatling Turret`, `Frost Turret` (slows enemies), `Artillery Cannon` (long-range siege damage).
    *   **Ultimate**: `Overcharge` - Temporarily doubles the attack speed and damage of all active turrets and grants them a protective shield.
*   **Golemancer**: Builds and commands a single, powerful Golem companion.
    *   **Core Abilities**: The Golem's abilities are determined by modules the Artificer crafts and installs (e.g., `Siege Fists`, `Shield Generator`, `Flamethrower Arm`).
